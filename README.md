Getting Started


I am a 50 year old man that has started out on a new path after being declaired disabled and unable to work.
As i am only not able to walk well I thought i would put my brain to some use and started creating websites using wordpress.
I have used Joomla and some Html in the past but that was just to play around a bit.
I am now learning Html and CSS at a very slow rate but slow and steady will get me there..
